        <p id = 'h6'> <strong><span class="plant-big">Plant a banana</span></strong> pup or rhizome in a sunny, sheltered spot with rich, well-draining soil. Water the plant frequently to keep the soil consistently moist, especially during hot, dry weather, and fertilize monthly with a high-potassium fertilizer. Remove any unwanted suckers around the base, leaving only one or two, and protect the plant from frost during winter. <p>
